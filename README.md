# ISL-IDENTIFICATION-WITH-TRANSLATION-AND-STANDARDIZATION
The model identifies sign language and returns a proper sentence in desired language in audio as well as visual format.

NOTE: Model training will require a computer with a discrete Nvidia GPU for processing visual data.


The dependencies are:-
:mediapipe
:keras
:sklearn
:pyttsx3
:streamlit
:pandas
:numpy
:tensorflow
:openCV


This repository contains a basic model that can predict a few signs, code for streamlit frontend to run the model and code base to train the model further as per personal preference.
