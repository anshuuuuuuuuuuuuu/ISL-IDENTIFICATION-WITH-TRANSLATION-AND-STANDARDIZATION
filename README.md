# ISL-IDENTIFICATION-WITH-TRANSLATION-AND-STANDARDIZATION
The model identifies sign language and returns a proper sentence in desired language in audio as well as visual format.
 
NOTE: Model training will require a computer with a dedicated Nvidia GPU for processing visual data.
<br/>
Make Sure to add some of your custom signs to try and test the model. The model uses certain libraries which requires GPU processing , so ensure that you must have GPU enabled device. 
 
The dependencies are:-    
* mediapipe<br/>  
* keras<br/>
* sklearn <br/>     
* pyttsx3 <br/>    
* streamlit<br/> 
* pandas<br/>
* numpy<br/>
* tensorflow<br/>
* openCV <br/>

**This project was Associated with SIH24 under PS1716 for Sign Language to Text/Speech Conversion**.  

This repository contains a basic model that can predict a few signs, code for streamlit frontend to run the model and code base to train the model further as per personal preference.To try out the project just clone model and app.py file and run folder in a environment with above dependenices loaded .
