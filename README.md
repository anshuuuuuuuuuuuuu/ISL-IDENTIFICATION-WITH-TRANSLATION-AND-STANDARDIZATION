# ISL-IDENTIFICATION-WITH-TRANSLATION-AND-STANDARDIZATION
The model identifies sign language and returns a proper sentence in desired language in audio as well as visual format.

NOTE: Model training will require a computer with a discrete Nvidia GPU for processing visual data.
<br/>
Make Sure to add some of your custom signs to try and test the model.


The dependencies are:-
* mediapipe<br/>
* keras<br/>
* sklearn<br/>
* pyttsx3<br/>
* streamlit<br/>
* pandas<br/>
* numpy<br/>
* tensorflow<br/>
* openCV<br/>


This repository contains a basic model that can predict a few signs, code for streamlit frontend to run the model and code base to train the model further as per personal preference.To try out the project just clone model and app.py file and run team in a environment with above dependenices loaded
